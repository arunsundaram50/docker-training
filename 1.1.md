# 1.1 Understand storage classes, persistent volumes

In Kubernetes (k8s), applications typically run in ephemeral containers, meaning that the data stored within the container's filesystem disappears when the container is destroyed. Therefore, if an application needs to store data in a persistent manner, it needs a mechanism to do so. This is where StorageClasses, PersistentVolumes (PVs), and PersistentVolumeClaims (PVCs) come into play.

1. **StorageClasses**: StorageClasses provide a way for administrators to describe the "classes" of storage they offer. Different classes might map to different quality-of-service levels, backup policies, or other administrative policies determined by the cluster administrator. For example, a cluster may have fast SSD storage for high I/O workloads and slower, economical HDD storage for less demanding workloads.

2. **PersistentVolumes (PVs)**: PVs are a resource in the Kubernetes system that represents a piece of storage in the cluster that has been provisioned by an administrator or dynamically provisioned using Storage Classes. PVs are volume plugins like Volumes, but have a lifecycle independent of any individual pod that uses the PV.

3. **PersistentVolumeClaims (PVCs)**: PVCs are a request for storage by a user. It is similar to a pod. Pods consume node resources and PVCs consume PV resources. Pods can request specific levels of resources (CPU and Memory). Claims can request specific size and access modes (e.g., they can be mounted as read-write or read-only).

Some examples of StorageClasses:

- **AWS EBS**: For AWS, you can provision an EBS volume as a PV.
- **Google Persistent Disk**: For Google Cloud Platform, you can provision a Google compute persistent disk.
- **Azure Disk**: For Microsoft Azure, you can provision an Azure Disk.
- **CephFS**: An open-source storage platform that implements a distributed filesystem.
- **GlusterFS**: A scalable network filesystem that can be used to create large, distributed storage solutions for media streaming, data analysis, and other data- and bandwidth-intensive tasks.
- **OpenEBS**: An open-source project from the CNCF that enables the use of storage services or storage-like interfaces, such as replication and pooling on a Kubernetes platform.
- **Rook**: An open-source, cloud-native storage orchestrator for Kubernetes, providing the platform, framework for storage management and serving as a control plane.

Regarding PersistentVolumes, an example would be creating a PV using the AWS EBS storage class:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolume
metadata:
  name: pv-demo
spec:
  capacity:
    storage: 10Gi
  volumeMode: Filesystem
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  persistentVolumeReclaimPolicy: Retain
  storageClassName: aws-ebs
  awsElasticBlockStore:
    volumeID: "<volume-id>"
```

In this example, the PersistentVolume uses the "aws-ebs" StorageClass and attaches to an existing EBS volume with the specified volume ID. This PV would then be available for a PersistentVolumeClaim to bind to, and ultimately provide storage for a Pod.

Remember that in Kubernetes, all these concepts are to ensure data persistence across pod lifecycle and even if a pod is rescheduled, the data will be available for the application. It's also important for sharing data between different pods.
