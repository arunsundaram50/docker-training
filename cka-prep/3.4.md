# 3.4 Understand the primitives used to create robust, self-healing, application deployments

Kubernetes (k8s) provides several primitives or objects that allow for robust, self-healing application deployments. These objects provide ways to control compute resources, network traffic, and storage resources, and they allow you to deploy, maintain, and scale your applications. Here are some of the key Kubernetes primitives:

1. **Pods**: The smallest and simplest unit in the Kubernetes object model that you create or deploy. A Pod encapsulates an application container (or, in some cases, multiple containers), storage resources, a unique network IP, and options that govern how the container(s) should run.

2. **Services**: An abstract way to expose an application running on a set of Pods as a network service. This decouples the backend workloads from the frontend, allowing for independent scaling and deployments.

3. **ReplicaSets**: Ensures that a specified number of pod replicas are running at any given time. They are ideal for stateless applications but not suitable for stateful applications such as databases.

4. **Deployments**: Provides declarative updates for Pods and ReplicaSets. You describe a desired state in a Deployment, and the Deployment Controller changes the actual state to the desired state at a controlled rate. They are generally used for stateless applications.

5. **StatefulSets**: Manages the deployment and scaling of a set of Pods, and provides guarantees about the ordering and uniqueness of these Pods. It's suitable for stateful applications like databases.

6. **DaemonSets**: Ensures that all (or some) nodes run a copy of a Pod. As nodes are added to the cluster, Pods are added to them. As nodes are removed from the cluster, those Pods are garbage collected.

7. **Jobs and CronJobs**: Job creates one or more pods and ensures that a specified number of them successfully terminate. When a specified number of successful completions is reached, the job is complete. CronJob manages time-based Jobs, i.e., Jobs that are run at scheduled times.

8. **Ingress**: Manages external access to the services in a cluster, typically HTTP. Ingress may provide load balancing, SSL termination and name-based virtual hosting.

9. **Volumes**: Provides shared storage for containers in a pod, and allow you to persist data across pod restarts.

10. **ConfigMaps and Secrets**: Allow you to separate your application's configuration and sensitive data from your application code, which can help to keep your applications more secure and more portable.

11. **Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA)**: Automatically scales the number of pods in a replication controller, deployment, replica set or stateful set based on observed CPU utilization (or, with custom metrics support, on some other application-provided metrics).

12. **PodDisruptionBudget (PDB)**: Provides an application owner with a way to limit the impact of Pod disruption caused by voluntary actions taken by a cluster administrator or by the Kubernetes control plane itself.

To ensure high availability and redundancy, the application should also be architected to be stateless as much as possible, and to gracefully handle failures and restarts.
