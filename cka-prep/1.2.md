# 1.2 Understand volume mode, access modes and reclaim policies for volumes
1. **Volume Mode**: The VolumeMode field can take on two possible values: `Filesystem` and `Block`. `Filesystem` is the default mode used when VolumeMode parameter is omitted. When set to `Filesystem`, a directory will be created on the volume to store data. When set to `Block`, a raw block device will be created.

   - `Filesystem`: This mode is used when you want to store files in a filesystem format in the volume. It means that you can mount this volume as a directory, and all files in this directory will be saved in this volume.
   
   - `Block`: This mode is used when you want to provide raw block device volumes for containers. This is similar to mounting a disk directly to your PC without any filesystem on it.

Here is an example of a PersistentVolume with a `Filesystem` volume mode:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolume
metadata:
  name: pv-demo
spec:
  capacity:
    storage: 10Gi
  volumeMode: Filesystem
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  persistentVolumeReclaimPolicy: Retain
  storageClassName: manual
  hostPath:
    path: "/mnt/data"
```

Here is an example of a PersistentVolume with a `Block` volume mode:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolume
metadata:
  name: pv-demo
spec:
  capacity:
    storage: 10Gi
  volumeMode: Block
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  persistentVolumeReclaimPolicy: Retain
  storageClassName: manual
  hostPath:
    path: "/mnt/data"
```

2. **Access Modes**: Access modes are the way that Kubernetes describes how a volume is mounted onto a container. There are three access modes:

   - `ReadWriteOnce (RWO)`: The volume can be mounted as read-write by a single node.
   
   - `ReadOnlyMany (ROX)`: The volume can be mounted read-only by many nodes.
   
   - `ReadWriteMany (RWX)`: The volume can be mounted as read-write by many nodes.

   Note that not all storage providers support all access modes.


Here is an example of a PersistentVolume with `ReadWriteOnce` access mode:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolume
metadata:
  name: pv-demo
spec:
  capacity:
    storage: 10Gi
  volumeMode: Filesystem
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  persistentVolumeReclaimPolicy: Retain
  storageClassName: manual
  hostPath:
    path: "/mnt/data"
```

Here is an example of a PersistentVolume with `ReadOnlyMany` access mode:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolume
metadata:
  name: pv-demo
spec:
  capacity:
    storage: 10Gi
  volumeMode: Filesystem
  accessModes:
    - ReadOnlyMany
  persistentVolumeReclaimPolicy: Retain
  storageClassName: manual
  hostPath:
    path: "/mnt/data"
```

Here is an example of a PersistentVolume with `ReadWriteMany` access mode:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolume
metadata:
  name: pv-demo
spec:
  capacity:
    storage: 10Gi
  volumeMode: Filesystem
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteMany
  persistentVolumeReclaimPolicy: Retain
  storageClassName: manual
  hostPath:
    path: "/mnt/data"
```


3. **Reclaim Policy**: The Reclaim Policy of a PersistentVolume tells Kubernetes what to do with the volume after it has been released from its claim. Currently, volumes can either be `Retained`, `Recycled`, or `Deleted`.

   - `Retain`: Manual reclamation of the resource. When the PersistentVolumeClaim is deleted, the PersistentVolume still exists and the volume is considered "released". But it is not yet available for another claim because the previous claimant's data remains on the volume. An administrator can manually reclaim the volume with data cleanup.

   - `Delete`: The volume is deleted, which is the default policy for dynamic provisioned volumes. 

   - `Recycle`: Deprecated. The volume is scrubbed of all data and made available again for a new claim. This method is generally not recommended and is replaced by dynamic provisioning.


Here is an example of a PersistentVolume with `Retain` reclaim policy:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolume
metadata:
  name: pv-demo
spec:
  capacity:
    storage: 10Gi
  volumeMode: Filesystem
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  persistentVolumeReclaimPolicy: Retain
  storageClassName: manual
  hostPath:
    path: "/mnt/data"
```

Here is an example of a PersistentVolume with `Delete` reclaim policy:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolume
metadata:
  name: pv-demo
spec:
  capacity:
    storage: 10Gi
  volumeMode: Filesystem
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  persistentVolumeReclaimPolicy: Delete
  storageClassName: manual
  hostPath:
    path: "/mnt/data"
```

It's important to choose the right configuration that suits your application's data and concurrency requirements while ensuring data durability and availability as needed.

Note that each of the examples above uses a HostPath for the PersistentVolume. HostPath is a type of volume that mounts a file or directory from the host node's filesystem into your pod. This is not suitable for production use! In a production scenario, you would use a network storage solution like AWS EBS, Google Persistent Disk, or an NFS mount.

Also, the `Recycle` reclaim policy has been deprecated.

The `Recycle` reclaim policy was deprecated because it had some limitations, primarily that it only supported scrubbing a volume clean so it could be reused. However, this did not really fit the use cases for which many people were using volumes, particularly where data needed to be securely wiped or different kinds of preparation needed to be made on the volumes.

In place of the `Recycle` reclaim policy, dynamic volume provisioning has taken over. With dynamic provisioning, instead of a cluster administrator manually creating PersistentVolumes, they are automatically created when a user creates a PersistentVolumeClaim. When a user is done with a volume, they can delete the PVC and the underlying PersistentVolume is also automatically deleted.

The default reclaim policy for dynamically provisioned volumes is `Delete`, which means the volume is automatically cleaned up when a user deletes their claim to it. If a cluster administrator wishes to manually clean up volumes, they can set the reclaim policy to `Retain`. In the `Retain` case, after a volume's claim is deleted, the volume enters a `Released` phase, where all of its data can be manually recovered.

This change allows for more flexibility in managing storage resources within Kubernetes and better reflects how many users and organizations want to handle their storage lifecycle.
