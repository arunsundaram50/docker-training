In Minikube, you typically work with a single cluster at a time, as Minikube is designed for local development and testing. Therefore, the concept of listing multiple clusters doesn't apply directly to Minikube in the way it would with a multi-cluster Kubernetes setup. However, there are a few things you can do to get information about the cluster you are currently working with:

1. To get the status of the Minikube cluster, you can use the `minikube status` command:
    ```bash
    minikube status
    ```
   
2. If you are running multiple Minikube profiles (which would allow you to effectively have multiple "clusters"), you can list those profiles with:
    ```bash
    minikube profile list
    ```
   
3. To get information about the nodes in your Minikube cluster, you can use the `kubectl get nodes` command:
    ```bash
    kubectl get nodes
    ```
   
4. To list all the pods running in the cluster, you can use:
    ```bash
    kubectl get pods --all-namespaces
    ```
   
5. To list all the services, you can use:
    ```bash
    kubectl get svc --all-namespaces
    ```

Remember that Minikube is meant to be a single-node cluster for development and testing. You can switch between different Minikube profiles if you need to work with different clusters, but each profile is essentially a different single-node cluster.
