Certainly! Let's consider a simple yet useful scenario.

### Use Case: Automatic Namespace Expiry

In larger organizations or active development environments, it's common to spin up namespaces for testing, staging, or temporary work. Over time, these namespaces can accumulate and consume cluster resources, even if they're no longer in use.

A CRD for `NamespaceExpiry` could be used to define an expiration time for a namespace, after which the namespace and its resources are automatically cleaned up.

### CRD: `NamespaceExpiry`

**Structure:**
```yaml
apiVersion: custom.k8s.io/v1
kind: NamespaceExpiry
metadata:
  name: my-temporary-namespace-expiry
spec:
  namespace: my-temporary-namespace
  ttl: 72h
```

- `namespace`: The target namespace that this rule applies to.
- `ttl`: Time to Live. After this duration from the creation timestamp of the `NamespaceExpiry` resource, the specified namespace will be deleted.

**Controller Behavior:**
- When a `NamespaceExpiry` resource is created, the controller starts a timer based on the `ttl`.
- Once the `ttl` expires, the controller attempts to delete the specified namespace and all its resources.
- Optionally, before actual deletion, the controller can send notifications (using events or external mechanisms like email) to inform users about the impending deletion.

### Utility:

- This CRD provides an automated way to ensure temporary namespaces are cleaned up, helping manage cluster resources more efficiently.
- Development teams can create temporary namespaces with confidence, knowing they won't clutter the cluster indefinitely.
- Cluster administrators can enforce best practices, where temporary or non-production namespaces have associated `NamespaceExpiry` resources to prevent resource hogging.

Such a CRD is a small enhancement but can be instrumental in resource management and enforcing good practices within larger or active Kubernetes environments.
