Ex #1: Developers say for the traffic they expect, they need 50 replicas and each replica needs at least 25% CORE.
Calculate the number of cores needed in your node (host machine).

No of cores = REPLICAS / EXPECTED_CORE_PER_CONTAINER
= 50 / .25
= 200 CORES

Ex #2: Developers say for the traffic they expect, they need 50 replicas and each replica needs at least 25% CORE.
Calculate the number of cores needed in your node (host machine). The max core each node can have is 16.
No of cores = REPLICAS / EXPECTED_CORE_PER_CONTAINER
= 50 / .25
= 200 CORES
= 200 / MAX_CORES_PER_NODE = NO_OF_NODES
= 200 / 16 = 13 NODES
